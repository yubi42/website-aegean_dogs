## About the Website

I made this website at the request of my mother, who wanted to improve the website of a charitable association for an animal shelter on Aegina (Greece).
I tried to make it easy to access so that she could upload anything 'news' related independently. 

## About Aegean Dogs

Aegean Dogs is a charity that raises funds for an animal shelter on the island of Aegina. 
Ever since my mother and I adopted our first dog from there when I was 13, she has been actively helping wherever she can.
